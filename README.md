# Initial Proposal 
* Collect the Datasets available in form of different CSV files on kagle which are provided by Olist, 
the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces.
* Do the data visualization to understand the data set first.
* Since we want to predict review scores at the order level, we augmented the order and 
order reviews data set.
* If there are missing values for categorical and numerical variables in the dataset. 
We replaced categorical variables with unknown and numerical variables with 0.
* Run various predictive models to predict the review score of the dataset according to the variables of the dataset and to recommend the variable that matters to the customer the most which will be significant to the review score too. Also, we implement this model to understand logically if the customers churn or not. 
1.	Linear Regression Model
2.	The First Predictive Linear Regression Model
3.	Logistic Regression Model
4.	Random Forest Model
* Compare the various Predictive models and compare the accuracies of each and find the best fit model and analyze why particular model is the best fit.
* Predict the rating for new orders made and provide all important features which affect the rating. 
* After analyzing data set provide solution to improve the service so that they can bridge the gap between 
customer expectation and the service provided.
